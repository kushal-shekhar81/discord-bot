This is the code for a simple Discord Bot, which echoes and compliments users.
Run "pip install requirements.txt" before starting with the projects.

How to use?
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/ , and create a new application there.
2. Enter the name for your bot, and select "Create"
3. Choose "Bot" under Settings, and choose 'Click to reveal token' (or Regenerate if you are working for second or consecutive time). Copy the token generated, and paste it in the Bot.py program at the marked location
4. Once the python program has been saved and compiled, back in the discord developers website select on "OAuth2" under settings; Under 'Scopes' choose 'Bot', and copy the url (which will appear below) and paste it in a new browser to connect the bot to your server.

Once the bot is connected, run the Bot.py program, and once it is running go to the Discord server and try!
